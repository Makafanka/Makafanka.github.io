## Introduction

In an increasingly competitive and dynamic video game market, effective advertising strategies hinge on a clear understanding of the factors that drive global sales. Given a [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales/data) containing video game sales and related information, we would like to understand the game selling situation around the world and influencing factors and to develop a suitable advertising strategy according to the situation. In this project, we will try to solve the following questions:
* In which region will the game sell the most? (The most meaningful problem which we are going to focus on)
  With the popularisation of the internet, people around the world may have access to video games (Yufa et. al [1]). However, diverse cultural backgrounds, local economic conditions, levels of technological development, etc, could greatly affect the sales of different kinds of video games. With the information on the best sales region, we will be able to decide on suitable advertising volume for regions and know our advertising key areas.
* On which platform will the game be sold?
  Starting from the beginning of this century, hardware manufacturers, such as Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, have carefully developed a platform-based market where software sales subsidize relatively inexpensive hardware (Babb et. al [2]). In this highly competitive market, different platforms may face various groups of users, have complicated marketing strategies, and employ different maintenance groups. As a result, platforms may influence the sales of a particular game. We need to know the selling platforms, in order to design ads in line with platform sales strategies and user preferences.

In this project, we will use different machine learning models and algorithms, including Neural Network, Decision Tree, etc, to study and solve them. We are going to present our results and analyze them in order to get a better understanding of the dataset and seek for deeper insights. Here is the [Google Colab notebook] () that includes my code.

## Data

Our data comes from the Video Game Sales dataset in Kaggle. All data was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com [3]. The dataset contains 16598 different games with 11 separate fields. Below is a quick view of the dataset (picked by the first five rows). We can see from the graph that the
fields include Sale Rank, Game Name, Release Platform, Release Year, Publisher, Sales in NA, Sales in EU, Sales in JP, Sales in other places, and Global Sales.

## Conclusion

In this analysis, random forest classification proves to be a more effective and reliable approach than neural networks for predicting the best-selling markets for video games using the given dataset. While both models outperform a random selection strategy, the random forest achieves a reasonable accuracy of about 75% even without extensive optimization. In contrast, the neural network’s performance remains limited, likely due to the relatively small dataset, which can lead to overfitting and prevents it from fully leveraging its potential predictive power. Furthermore, random forests handle nonlinear, categorical data more efficiently (Roßbach, 2018 [4]), making them well-suited to these inputs. Although further accuracy improvements with random forests come at the cost of increased runtime, this trade-off appears more manageable and beneficial than attempting to train a neural network with insufficient data. Ultimately, random forest classification emerges as the more practical choice for guiding advertising strategies based on this dataset.
