## Introduction

In an increasingly competitive and dynamic video game market, effective advertising strategies hinge on a clear understanding of the factors that drive global sales. Given a [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales/data) containing video game sales and related information, we would like to understand the game selling situation around the world and influencing factors and to develop a suitable advertising strategy according to the situation. In this project, we will try to solve the following questions:
* In which region will the game sell the most? (The most meaningful problem which we are going to focus on)
  With the popularisation of the internet, people around the world may have access to video games (Yufa et. al [^1]). However, diverse cultural backgrounds, local economic conditions, levels of technological development, etc, could greatly affect the sales of different kinds of video games. With the information on the best sales region, we will be able to decide on suitable advertising volume for regions and know our advertising key areas.
* On which platform will the game be sold?
  Starting from the beginning of this century, hardware manufacturers, such as Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, have carefully developed a platform-based market where software sales subsidize relatively inexpensive hardware (Babb et. al [^2]). In this highly competitive market, different platforms may face various groups of users, have complicated marketing strategies, and employ different maintenance groups. As a result, platforms may influence the sales of a particular game. We need to know the selling platforms, in order to design ads in line with platform sales strategies and user preferences.

In this project, we will use different machine learning models and algorithms, including Neural Network, Decision Tree, etc, to study and solve them. We are going to present our results and analyze them in order to get a better understanding of the dataset and seek for deeper insights. Here is the [Google Colab notebook] () that includes my code.

## Data

Our data comes from the Video Game Sales dataset in Kaggle. All data was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com [^3]. The dataset contains 16598 different games with 11 separate fields. Below is a quick view of the dataset (picked by the first five rows). We can see from the graph that the
fields include Sale Rank, Game Name, Release Platform, Release Year, Publisher, Sales in NA, Sales in EU, Sales in JP, Sales in other places, and Global Sales.

## Conclusion

In this analysis, random forest classification proves to be a more effective and reliable approach than neural networks for predicting the best-selling markets for video games using the given dataset. While both models outperform a random selection strategy, the random forest achieves a reasonable accuracy of about 75% even without extensive optimization. In contrast, the neural network’s performance remains limited, likely due to the relatively small dataset, which can lead to overfitting and prevents it from fully leveraging its potential predictive power. Furthermore, random forests handle nonlinear, categorical data more efficiently (Roßbach, 2018 [^4]), making them well-suited to these inputs. Although further accuracy improvements with random forests come at the cost of increased runtime, this trade-off appears more manageable and beneficial than attempting to train a neural network with insufficient data. Ultimately, random forest classification emerges as the more practical choice for guiding advertising strategies based on this dataset.

### How to copy this site as a template
1. Create [a GitHub account](https://github.com/)
2.	Go to [https://github.com/atmosalex/atmosalex.github.io/](https://github.com/atmosalex/atmosalex.github.io/) and click *Use this template*, then **Create a new repository**. [![screenshot][1]][1]
3.	In the box that says *Repository name*, write your **Github username**, followed by **.github.io**, as shown in the screenshot below. Then click **Create repository** at the bottom. [![screenshot][2]][2]
4.	Go to the *Settings* tab, then click *Pages* (under *Code and automation*). In the *Build and deployment* section, under **Branch**, select "main" and click save (if it isn't already selected). It should look like this: [![screenshot][3]][3]
5.	Click the *Actions* tab at the top of the page and check that the build and deployment action has finished. Once it has, navigate to **[your username].github.io** to see your site, which should be a copy of this one! If you cannot see an *Actions* tab, just wait a few minutes then go to your URL to check it is live.

Now you are ready to customize your site! To add your name to the site, go to your repository page on Github, click `_config.yml`, and edit it to replace the temporary title with your name, etc. When we make changes to a project on Github, we have to **commit** the new version of each file. Github keeps track of all the changes we make, making it easy to roll back (i.e. return the project to a previous commit).

### How to change the theme (optional)
1.	You can choose any theme [listed on this page](https://pages.github.com/themes/), though some do not work as well on mobile devices.
2.	From GitHub, edit `_config.yml` and replace the `theme:` line with `theme: jekyll-theme-name` where `name` is the name of the theme from the above list. **For the `minima` theme, use a shortened preface like so `theme: minima`**, the others seem to need the whole preface `theme: jekyll-theme-`. You can check the *Actions* tab (as in step 5. above) to make sure the site is building successfully.

### How to change your site logo (optional)
1. Some themes, such as `jekyll-theme-minimal`, show a logo. In your repository, upload a logo or profile picture to the `assets/IMG/` directory
2. Open `_config.yml` and modify the line `logo: /assets/IMG/template_logo.png` to point to your new image

## Guide to Adding Content
* Your repository's `README.md` file (the file you are reading now) acts like a home page. Replace its contents with whatever you want the world to see by editing the file on GitHub.
* If you want to turn this page into a CV or blog, etc., it may be useful to refer to a [guide for writing Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
* You can create other markdown files (.md) in your repository and navigate to them from this page using links, i.e.: [here is a link to another file, `project.md`](project.md)
* When editing a markdown file on GitHub, it is useful to wrap text by selecting the *Soft wrap* option as shown: ![screenshot](/assets/IMG/instr_wrap.png)
* If you want to get even more technical, you can also write HTML in your .md files, and GitHub Pages will render it. For example, the image below is displayed by writing the following (edit this file to see!): `<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="/assets/IMG/template_frog.png">`
<img align="right" width="337" height="200" src="/assets/IMG/template_frog.png">

## Delivering your Project

Your final project is delivered in two components: a report and your code.

### Report

Your report should be **delivered via your website**. Submit a link to your website on BruinLearn so that your instructor can browse it to find your report. 

To make this simple, you can write the report using a word processor or Latex, then export it as a .pdf file and upload it to the `assets` directory. You can then link to it [like so](/assets/project_demo.pdf). However, you can also type the report directly onto the website using another markdown page - [here is](/project.md) a template for that.

### Code

A link to your code must be submitted on BruinLearn, and the course instructor must be able to download your code to mark it. The code could be in a Google Colab notebook (make sure to *share* the notebook so access is set to **Anyone with the link**), or you could upload the code into a separate GitHub repository, or you could upload the code into the `assets` directory of your website and link to it.
